#### Aggravate. Irritate

aggravate 加剧，加剧问题的严重性，to add to
irritate 刺激，激怒，to annoy

#### all right

好吧，行吧，agreed, go ahead, ok

#### allude

暗示，暗指，隐射。allude 不是 refer 的同义词。reference 是精确的引用；allusion 是暗指，不直接的提起。

#### allusion

1. an indirect reference
2. an unreal image / a false impression

#### alternate, alternative

alternate 通常指其他很多替代物中的一个，"a substitute"。alternative 通常指两个选择中的另一个。

alternate 更多表达替代品的意思；而 alternative 则多用在二选一的场景下，突出选择。

#### among, between

```
The money was divided among the four players.
an agreement between the six heirs.
```

#### anticipate

预期，预料。在比较简单的预期含义中用 expect 来表达。比如

```
My brother anticipated the upturn in the market.
My brother expected the upturn in the market.
```

第二种表达中容易产生模糊含义，可能表达简单的预期，也可能表达提前采取了行动-比如买入股票之类的。

#### as to whether

不论。用 whether 就足够了。

#### as yet

迄今，到目前为止。只用 yet 也可以。

```
No agreement has been reached as yet.
No agreement has yet been reached.
```

#### case

这个词常常没有必要出现

```
In many case, the rooms lacked air conditioning.
Many of the rooms lacked air conditioning.

It has rarely been the case that any mistake has been made.
Few mistakes have been made.
```

#### certainly

口语里面经常被不分青红皂白地使用，就像"very"一样，被用来加强任何声明。在写作中这样不好。

#### character

这个词也是 often simply redundant.

```
acts of a hostile character
hostile acts
```

#### comprise, constitute

comprise, 包括, include; A zoo comprises mammals and birds.

constitute, 构成; Animals constitute a zoo.

#### consider

当表达"believe to be"的时候后面不用加"as"；当表达"discussed"时后面加"as"

```
I consider him competent.
The lecturer considered Eisenhower first as soldier and second as administrator.
```

#### contact

作为一个及物动词，这个词含义含糊不清(vague)。

Do not contact people; get in touch with them, look them up, phone them, find them, or meet them.

#### currently

用于强调 now 的意思，但是这个词也通常是冗余而不精确的。如果想强调 now 的含义最好用时间上更精确的表达。

```
We are currently reviewing your application.
We are at this moment reviewing your application.
```

#### data

和 strara, phenimena, media 这些词一样，data 是复数。（有时候也可用作单数，但是感觉不一样）

```
The data is misleading.
These data are misleading.
```

#### Disinterested

公正的，无私的，impartial 的；不是"not interested in"

#### enormity

艰巨, "monstrous wickedness"

#### Etc

"and other things", "and the rest", "等等"

```
They ate cookies, cakes, peanuts, fairy floss, etc.
```

#### Farther, Further

这两个词通常可以互换，但是有一个值得观察的区别： farther 最好表示距离，further 最好表示时间或数量。

You chase a ball farther than the other fellow; you pursue a subject further.

#### Fortuitous

仅限于偶然发生的事情。不得用于幸运或幸运。

#### Gratuitous

Means "unearned," or "unwarranted."

#### He is a man who

典型的冗余表达，直接 He is 不完了。

#### imply, infer

不可互换，imply 有建议或指示的东西；infer 是推断。

```
Farming implies early rising.
Since she was a farmer, we inferred that she got up early.
```

#### in regard to

关于，"as regards"；常被误写作"in regards to"

#### insightful.

The word is a suspicious overstatement for "perceptive."

```
That was an insightful remark you made.
That was a perceptive remark you made.
```

#### in terms of

通常可以省略

```
The job was unattractive in terms of salary.
The salary made the job unattractive.
```

#### like, as

like 后面应该是名词或代词，如果是短语或从句的话应该用 as

```
We spent the evening as in the old days.
Chloe smells good, as a baby should.
```

#### literal, literally

经常错误地用于支持夸张(exaggeration)或比喻(metaphor)。

#### loan, lend

lend 用作动词, loan 用作名词

```
lend me your ears.
the loan of your ears.
```

#### possess

具有。这个词通常因为作者觉得它很 impressive 而被使用。使用这个词虽然没错，但是看起来怪怪的。

```
She possessed great courage.
She had great courage
```

#### Prestigious

声望很高的

#### Secondly, thirdly, etc.

除非你用 firstly 开头，否则更现代的写法是直接用 second, third...

#### Shall, will

在正式书写中，shall 由于第一人称, will 用于第二第三人称。除此之外，shall 和 will 还有一点感觉上的不同(我也不知道咋解释，请自行体会)

```
I shall drown; no one will save me. 我要淹死了，没人会来救我的。
I will drown; no one shall save me. 我要自杀了，谁都别来救我。
```

#### The truth is..., The fact is

A bad beginning for a sentence.如果你要表达某个真理或真相，直接 state it.不必在前面加这么一段。

#### Utilize

Prefer use
