## 俗语

如果你要用俗语，就直接使用，不要用引号把它括起来。

## 感叹句

不要试图用感叹号来强调简单句的语气，比如下面这个句子就不应该用感叹号

```
It was a wonderful show!
It was a wonderful show.
```

感叹号应该用在真正的感叹句后面，或者在命令后面。

```
What a wonderful show!
Halt!
```

## 标题

如果一份手稿是用来提交并出版的，你需要在第一页的顶部留出足够的空间。编辑需要这些空间来写一些指导。
至少要在标题上方留出四分之一页的空白。在标题后面需要留出空行或等效的空间。

## Margins

页面两边要留差不多相同宽度的空间，除非你认为文章需要大量的标注和编辑。

## Numerals

在需要用数字的地方直接写数字，而不是把它拼写出来。比如

```
August 9, 1988
Rule 3
```

## Parentheses(括号)

对于一个包含括号的句子来说，去掉括号的部分应当能够完整表达含义，而括号内的句子也应当可以独立存在。

```
I went to her house yesterday (my third attempt to see her), but she had left town.

He declares (and why should we doubt his good faith?) that he is now certain of success.
```

## Quotations
